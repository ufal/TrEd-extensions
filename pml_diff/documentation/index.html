    <h1>Simple PML Diff Extension for TrEd</h1>
    <p>
      This extension provides the basic visual diffing
      interface. It works only on simple annotation schemas where the
      relation of tokens to nodes is 1:1 and the #ORDER role is defined.
    </p>

    <p>The extension is still under development. You have to manually
    set up several things in order to get it work for your data:

      <ol type=1>
      <li>Open any pml file
      <li>Click on Style name, select New From Current
      <li>Enter diff as Name, click OK
      <li>Click on the icon before diff, remove the <tt>context:</tt>
        line, click OK
      <li>Close TrEd
    </ol>

    <p>Now, you should be able to run the diff just by

<pre>tred -t PML_Diff -s diff -p2 file1.pml file2.pml</pre>

    <p>If you prefer clicking to command line options, once the
      extension is prepared, you can also do everything in TrEd: open
      one file, split the window, open the second file, lock them
      together, adjust the mode and stylesheet (but it gets annoying
      if you plan to repeat it many times).</p>

    <p>
      Use arrow icons to browse the trees (both files should advance
      simultaneously). Press <keyb>=</keyb> to view diff for the
      current trees.  Press <keyb>Ctrl + =</keyb> to configure the
      attributes to compare.  Use <keyb>Alt + =</keyb> to run diff on
      the whole file. Use <keyb>Ctrl + Shift + =</keyb> to view some
      statistics.
    </p>
