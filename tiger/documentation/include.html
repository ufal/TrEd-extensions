<em>Warning: </em> In the original Tiger Treebank 1.0, there were no
  edges connecting punctuation to trees. The conversion contained in
  this extension makes all the punctuation nodes into children of the
  topmost nonterminal with a special label <code>$</code>. When
  converting back to TigerXML, all the edges with such a label are
  deleted.
